Since the micro architecture of AI chips are different from different vendors, so is Ascend, which quite different with NV GPU. This repo provides the best practices of writing computing kernel using Triton Language on Ascend. To show the best practices, here provide three types of example:
* basic: basic examples 
* op_extension: examples of extended operations provided by Triton Ascend
* transformer: examples used in transformer models and inference engine for LLM
