# Ascend Triton Example

## News

## About
Since the chip micro architecture of AI chips are different from difference vendors. Ascend chip architecture is different with NV GPU. The repo provides the best practices of writing computing kernel using Triton Language on Ascend. To show the best practice, here provide three types of example:
* basic: basic examples 
* op_extension: examples of extension operation provided by Triton Ascend only
* transformer: examples used in transformer models and inference engine for LLM

## How run it 

#### Prerequisite

* CANN
* Pytorch and Pytorch Ascend
